# Automated Tumor Detection in Medical Images

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for early detection of lung cancer nodules using chest CT scan images. Early and accurate diagnosis of lung tumors is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The model processes CT scan images and classifies them into three categories: Normal, Benign, and Malignant cases.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of CT scan images sourced from medical imaging datasets, such as Kaggle and IQ-OTHNCCD. These datasets provide annotated data essential for training and validating CNNs.
* Class distribution in the training set:
    **Normal: 3300 images
    ** Benign: 2300 images
    **Malignant: 3100 images
